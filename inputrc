# Create ~/.inputrc file 
# and fill it with this:

"\e[A": history-search-backward
"\e[B": history-search-forward

# This allows you to search through your history using the up and down arrows
# i.e. type "cd" and press the up arrow and you'll search through everything in your history that starts with "cd".
